# McCabe–Thiele Distillation Simulator

An interactive Python tool to visualize and simulate binary distillation using the McCabe–Thiele construction.  
This project combines chemical engineering principles with Python (Tkinter + Matplotlib) to create an educational and design tool.  

# Features
- Interactive GUI for parameter input (relative volatility, feed composition, reflux ratio, etc.).
- Automatic plotting of:
  - Equilibrium curve
  - Operating lines (rectifying, stripping, q-line)
  - Stage-by-stage construction
- Displays minimum number of stages including reboiler.
- Educational tool for learning distillation design.
